# Balancer
This project implements a balancer for a ceailing fan.
An arduino with a mems accelerometer is used to measure acceleration. An
infrared diod and infrared sensor are used to detect the fan blades thus
creating a reference signal.

The data is transmitted to a computer where the final imbalance is calculated.

After calculating the imbalance the counter weights can be distributed onto
the blades.
